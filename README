trac-git-plugin
===============

This is a port of http://www.trac-hacks.org/wiki/GitPlugin for Trac 0.12.  See
the trac-hacks site for more information.


Current Status
--------------

The plugin seems to be working well at the moment.  Multi-repository support
is working, as are both the cached and uncached repository options.  Some
parts might still be a little rough around the edges though :)
